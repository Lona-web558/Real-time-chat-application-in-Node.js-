I'll create a real time chat application using Node.js with traditional JavaScript syntax.

I've created a real-time chat application using Node.js with traditional JavaScript syntax. The application uses:

**Built-in modules only:**
- `http` - for the web server
- `fs` - for reading the HTML file
- `path` - for file path operations

**Features:**
- Real-time messaging using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- No external dependencies or modules
- Traditional JavaScript syntax (var, function declarations, no arrow functions)
- Message history for new clients
- Username support
- Timestamps for each message

**To run this application:**

1. Save the server code as `server.js`
2. Extract the HTML from the comments and save it as `client.html` in the same directory
3. Run `node server.js`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Open multiple browser tabs to test the real-time chat

The application broadcasts messages to all connected clients in real-time. Each message shows the username, timestamp, and message content.
